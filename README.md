<h1>Travel Guide</h1>
<h2>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Requirements</h2>
<p>Create a Web-based application to help tourists experience their destination by offering information about interesting locations near them. The web application is supposed to include three parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Blog-like pages with articles about travel destinations</li>
<li>Map of interesting locations around tourist towns and places a user has visited</li>
<li>Administration interface for publishing articles and managing locations</li>
</ul>
<p>Provide the following functionality to all visitors (without authentication):</p>
<ul>
<li>Read articles about travel destinations</li>
<li>View recommendations on a map</li>
<li>Advanced search (by category, nearby events, price range, location, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the previous functionality, registered users can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Leave comments on the map</li>
<li>Mark the places they&rsquo;ve already visited and post their pictures</li>
</ul>
<p>Authenticated administrators should be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Publish and edit articles</li>
<li>Manage locations on the map</li>
<li>Moderate messages left by registered users</li>
</ul>
<p>The app uses a mapping API (Google Maps, BGMaps).</p>
<p><strong>Create a Web UI prototype for the Travel Guide system.</strong></p>
<h2>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Team Organization</h2>
<p>Create a GitHub organization for all team members, or a GitHub project with collaborators. Initialize the project with a Readme.md file in which you should describe what each team member is doing.</p>
<p>Split the different views (core pages) of your assignment and have each team member work on at least one task. Commit the results to the GitHub repository.</p>
<h2>3.&nbsp;&nbsp; Tools</h2>
<p>When creating the prototypes, you are free to use <strong>whatever method you like</strong>, including paper and post-it notes (take pictures and commit them to the repository). Additionally, you may use image editing software, HTML+CSS, or a prototyping tool (Indigo Studio, Balsamiq, etc.).</p>
<h2>4.&nbsp;&nbsp; Submitting Your Work</h2>
<p>You have until <strong>9. July</strong> to submit a <strong>link to your GitHub</strong> repository on the course page under Exercise: Creating a UI Prototype:</p>
<p><a href="https://softuni.bg/trainings/1686/practical-teamwork-javascript-may-2017">https://softuni.bg/trainings/1686/practical-teamwork-javascript-may-2017</a></p>
<p>If you used a prototyping tool that works online, submit a link to your <strong>project page</strong> instead, and make sure it&rsquo;s publicly accessible. <strong><em>Every team member submits the same link!</em></strong></p>
